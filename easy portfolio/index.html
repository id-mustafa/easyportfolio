								<p> Hello world! I’m an aspiring software engineer and database systems aficionado, currently
                    				enriching my knowledge base at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the 
									Computer Science department. My academic focus lies in
                    				the intricate world of software engineering and database systems, where I’m dedicated to 
									understanding the underpinnings of robust tech infrastructures and the
                    				efficient handling of data.

								<h2 class="major">interests</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/engineering.jpeg" alt=""></span>
								<p> This page is meant to be a place where I can express some of the innovative thoughts I have
									and what interests me</p>
									<ol>
									<li> Idea: Building a multinational tech conglomerate that solves problems to different areas of tech
										from server hosting and cloud infrastructure to Cybersecurity tools to Computer Hardware to Data Solutions
										and visualization AI. I'm interested in this because in order to truly be a successful company and entrepreneur,
										you would need to add value across the board in multiple sectors.
									</li>
									
									<li>
										Idea: What if a company's data needs were to be automated? Working as a Data Visualization Engineer right now for UNC, 
										I've come to realize how integral data is to every business decision that the school makes. Oftentimes, my work consists of
										getting a request from an admin that says "We would like to find how many students participated in X organization during Y year(s)."
										and I feel like maybe there is a way to automate these requests to be handled by a data-centric AI.
									</li>
								
									<li>
										Idea: If you're anything like me, you grew up on Sci-Fi shows that showcased a series of holograms as a part of their utopia.
										What if these holograms don't have to be fiction anymore? What if we can find a way to bring these to life by distorting the way photons
										collide with one another to create an exact image of what we'd like to see. This is how projectors work but what if we can find a way to suspend
										photons in place to create this seemingly floating image?
									</li>
									
									<li>
										Idea: Ever heard stories about how machine learning is so saturated and how the LLM's take so long to train? Part of the imminent future is finding
										a way to speed up the learning of these models so that we can train AI in seconds rather than months. We need to drastically include every possible 
										outcome and train the AI model in a quantum capacity. I'd like to join the race to combine AI and Quantum mechanics fundamentals to speed up the time
										it takes to train an AI.
									</li>
							
									<li>
										Idea: Battery technology are slowly going out of fashion and their usability is limited as their capacities degrade over time. The idea is to utilize an energy source
										as potent as uranium without its radioactive risks invites consideration of advanced nuclear technologies, such as fusion energy or the use of radioisotope thermoelectric
										generators (RTGs) in a more controlled manner. Fusion energy, in particular, remains the holy grail of energy research, offering the promise of abundant, clean energy from
										reactions similar to those powering the sun. However, practical, controlled fusion for use in portable devices remains a formidable technical challenge, requiring significant 
										breakthroughs in containment and net energy production.
									</li>
								
									<li>
										Idea: One of my big dreams is to aid in the space exploration for a new world beyond our own. As I grew up reading more and more on NASA's acheivement and research,
										I noticed that there have been planets like ours discovered thousands of light years away. Future propulsion technologies such as nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), 
										nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and even theoretical concepts like antimatter engines, present feasible pathways to reduce travel time markedly. For instance, NTP, 
										utilizing nuclear reactions as a heat source to expel propellant at high speeds, offers a specific impulse several times greater than conventional chemical rockets. This
										could potentially cut down the travel time to Mars by half, setting a precedent for more ambitious interstellar voyages.
									</li>
								
									<li>
										Idea: Some black holes, particularly supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, emit powerful jets of electromagnetic radiation and subatomic particles at
										nearly the speed of light. These jets are believed to be generated by the magnetic fields around the accretion disks of black holes, though the precise mechanism is still
										a topic of research. Theoretically, these relativistic jets could be harnessed as cosmic-scale particle accelerators, potentially revealing new physics that are inaccessible
										to Earth-bound particle colliders. The interaction of these jets with the interstellar medium could provide valuable insights into high-energy physics and the behavior of 
										matter under extreme conditions. What if there was a way we can harness this energy and fundamentally reshape the physics of our world today?
									</li>
								
									<li>
										Idea: Current recycling efforts often focus on straightforward reuse or rudimentary processing of materials such as plastics, metals, and paper. However, these processes 
										sometimes overlook the energy-intensive nature of recycling or the degradation in quality of recycled materials. Advanced repurposing seeks to transform waste into higher-value 
										applications, thereby offering a dual benefit: reducing environmental impact and generating greater economic value from what was previously considered waste.
									</li>
							
									<li>
										Idea: In the future, I would like to be involved in launching my very own real estate private equity firm. Having gotten my real estate license as soon as I turned 18 years old, 
										I joined the cutthroat world of real estate, I found that real estate development had a significant impact on several key factors of human geography and socio-economic developent. 
										My focus is to primarily introduce real estate in areas that are underdeveloped and have a struggling economic status. Ultimately reshaping cities to be desirable for companies that
										attract talent in the area and beyond, essentially creating the next generation of wall street, silicon valley, and salt lake city.
									</li>
								
									<li>
										Idea: Not all my ambitions have to be too entrepreneurial or company-driven. Another goal of mine is to give back to disadvantaged and struggling communities in countries around the
										world. That doesn't mean that I would like to dump a pool of money in one area, that means I would like to introduce infrastructure for cities and villages that have no infrastructure from
										their respective governments. It is as the old adage goes, give a man a fish and you will only feed him for a day, but if you teach the man how to fish, then you will feed him for life. 
										I'd like to not only create infrastructure but also fund and create schools that support that infrastructure's continued development through social engineering.
									</li>
